# Manual Audio/Text Alignment Project for C-LARA

**Team Name:** Team Slay


## Project Description

Welcome to the Manual Audio/Text Alignment Project for C-LARA, developed by Team Slay. This project addresses a critical need within C-LARA.

**C-LARA Overview:**

C-LARA is a rework of the Learning and Reading Assistant (LARA), enhanced by ChatGPT. Its primary goal is to revolutionize language learning experiences by creating high-quality multimedia content for language courses. Specifically, it generates and annotates short stories, which are used to enrich language courses with adaptable, engaging content.

**The Challenge:**

One of the major challenges in C-LARA is the manual alignment of audio with text. For smaller languages, automated transcription and alignment tools are not feasible due to the limited availability of data. Presently, Audacity is used for this task, which involves a complex and time-consuming process.

**Our Solution:**

Our project aims to simplify this process by creating a web-based audio alignment tool. Users can upload existing audio and text files from the C-LARA database, manually align the audio with the text, and have the output automatically uploaded to C-LARA. This tool streamlines the manual audio alignment process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.
